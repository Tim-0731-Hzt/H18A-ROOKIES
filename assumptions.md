# test_auth_login.py
I could assume that the first user who login will have "u_id: 00001" and "token: 1", the second user will have "u_id: 00002" and "token: 2" and so on.

# test_auth_register.py
I could assume that the first user who register will have "u_id: 00001" and "token: 1", the second user will have "u_id: 00002" and "token: 2" and so on.

# test_channel_details.py
We need to set a function for set up the name of channel, or we couldn't get a return "name" from the function channel_details

# test_channel_messages.py
we need a function that could count the total number of messages. Now, I assume that the total number of messages are 150
