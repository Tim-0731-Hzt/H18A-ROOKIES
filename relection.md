**About Iteration 1**

Since the 4 group members were unioned in the week2 tute, we form a chat group that night to keep in touch with team members.
Jankie, Tim ,Jeff and Daniel.
We have our first group meeting Sunday , week2, briefly talked about the project and trying to make every member in the group
to understand what are we going to do in the following 9 weeks. During this period , we learnt about each other's programming 
skills and styles and favorite languages. And we decide to meet every Thursday noon and Sunday afternoon to talk about the 
process.
