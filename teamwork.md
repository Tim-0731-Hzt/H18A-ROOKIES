For Iteration2:
Our group have regular meetings 3 times a week : on Wednesday, Friday and  Sunday,
because we seperate the work in group of two, each group is mainly focusing on 
the code problems between group members.
And when someone comes with difficulties and unknown problems, it's more easier to
discuss in groups rather then individually search it in google.
A group meeting directly helps members to write and debug code. In a sufficent and 
elegant way.
Each meeting usually last at least 90 minutes, and even up to 4 hours once.
On week 6 we have some problems with the standup_start function and the 2 guys working
on it can not make it work on time, so 4 of us all working on this together , generating
different ideas on how to make it work and the way is should be performed, and finally
we have this completed.
During sprcial time , all group member can turn their aim on one certain things that 
troubles us.
We are using our own discord channel to make voice calls , and when someone is coming with 
the modifying in codes, he notify others to see the changes and commenting on his work,
so the one related to that piece of code will certainly know the changes he made, in case 
this is not gonna be the trouble in future.
When we are having meetings, usually one person sitting in front of the pc and writing code,
with his partner sitting around talking about the code aim and code style, they will have 
discussions about why this function are used instead of others, and when someone comes with problems, 
his partner can tell him the expected answer and his opinion about this.
At the final stage, the group will get together , before exchange their code , explain to their 
teammates how every functions work and what to remember, especially the abilitly they have achieved and 
not yet achieved.
