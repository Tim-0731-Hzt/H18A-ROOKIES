Teamwork
======

Our group have regular meetings 3 times a week : on Wednesday, Friday and  Sunday, because we seperated the work in group of two, each group is mainly focusing on the code problems between group members. When someone came across difficulties and unknown problems, it's more easier to discuss in groups rather then individually google it.

A group meeting directly helps members to write and debug code. In a sufficent and elegant way.

Each meeting usually last at least 90 minutes, and even up to 4 hours once.

On week 6 we have some problems with the standup_start function and the 2 guys working on it can not make it work on time, so 4 of us all working on this together, generating different ideas on how to make it work and the way is should be performed.

Facing strange problems, all group member can focus on one certain thing that troubles us.

We are using our own discord channel to make voice calls, and when someone is coming with the modifying in codes, he notify others to see the changes and commenting on his work, so the one related to that piece of code will certainly know the changes he made, in case this is not gonna be the trouble in future.

When we are having meetings, usually one person sitting in front of the pc and writing code, with his partner sitting around talking about the code aim and code style, we would have discussions about why this function are used instead of others, and when someone came across problems, his partner can tell him the expected answer and his opinion about this.

At the final stage, the group will get together, before exchange their code, explain to their teammates how every functions work and what to remember, especially the abilitly they have achieved and not yet achieved.
